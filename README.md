## UCSI IDP IoT Project

Requirements:
- Node.js

## Project Setup
For setting up react native CLI environment go to:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Follow exactly the documentation on creating a new device and changing JDK v11.0, otherwise the emulator with metro will not start

To check if you are available to run react native, run this in cmd/powershell terminal:

```
$ npx react-native start
```

open a new cmd/powershell terminal then run:
```
$ npx react-native run-android
```
